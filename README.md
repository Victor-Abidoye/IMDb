## Website Link
The link to the live project is available at [TMDb movie Trailer](https://tmdb-api-trailer.netlift.app)

## Recommended IDE Setup
The instructions will get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes

## perequisites
- GIT
- VUE

## known issue
- Since the Trailers are inserted from YouTube, I thought it would be better not to mess with the iframe size of the video in the modal because of the aspect ratio these videos come in
- Also, the API uses was from TMDb istead of IMDb because of issues with getting API key
